NAME
       GenDo - Amiga Autodoc Generator Command Line Tool

SYNOPSIS
       GenDo [INPUT=files] [TO=file] [AMIGAGUIDE] [PRESERVEORDER] [VERBOSE] [HELP]

       GenDo #?.c #?.cpp TO mylib.doc

DESCRIPTION
       GenDo is a command line tool for Amiga that generates autodoc documentation
       from C/C++ source files containing autodoc comments. The tool can process
       multiple input files and generate both .doc and .guide output formats.

       The tool can operate in two modes:
       1. Single file processing (direct mode)
       2. Multiple file processing with wildcard patterns (batch mode)

       Either INPUT or wildcard patterns must be provided. The tool supports
       AmigaDOS wildcard patterns for batch processing of multiple files.

PARAMETERS
       INPUT=files
              Input source files containing autodoc comments. Multiple files
              can be specified separated by spaces. Supports C and C++ files.

       TO=file
              Output filename for the generated documentation (mandatory).
              The .doc extension is automatically added if not specified.
              For AmigaGuide output, .guide extension is used.

       AMIGAGUIDE
              Generate AmigaGuide format output (.guide file) in addition to
              the standard .doc format. Creates a hyperlinked documentation
              with table of contents and navigation.

       PRESERVEORDER
              Preserve the original order of functions in the output instead
              of sorting them alphabetically. By default, functions are
              sorted alphabetically by name.

       VERBOSE
              Enable verbose output showing processing details, file parsing
              status, and debug information.

       HELP   Display usage information and exit.

WILDCARD PATTERNS
       GenDo supports AmigaDOS wildcard patterns for processing multiple files:

       #       Matches any single character
       ?       Matches any single character (same as #)
       *       Matches zero or more characters
       [abc]   Matches any character in the set
       (a|b)   Matches either 'a' or 'b'
       ~       Matches any character except the next one
       '       Matches the next character literally

       Examples:
              GenDo #?.c TO mylib.doc          ; All .c files
              GenDo *.cpp TO mylib.doc         ; All .cpp files
              GenDo test*.c TO mylib.doc       ; Files starting with 'test'
              GenDo [a-z]*.c TO mylib.doc      ; Files starting with lowercase

AUTODOC FORMAT
       GenDo parses autodoc comments in the following format:

       /**

EXAMPLES
       Generate documentation from single file:
              GenDo INPUT=myfile.c TO mylib.doc

       Generate documentation with AmigaGuide output:
              GenDo INPUT=myfile.c TO mylib.doc AMIGAGUIDE

       Process multiple files with wildcards:
              GenDo #?.c #?.cpp TO mylib.doc

       Process with verbose output and preserve order:
              GenDo #?.c TO mylib.doc PRESERVEORDER VERBOSE

       - Memory allocation failures
       - Pattern matching errors
       - Autodoc parsing errors
       - Output file creation failures

LIMITATIONS
       - Maximum input files: Limited by available memory
